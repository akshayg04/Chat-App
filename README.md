Task-3
Chat-App
The program is a simple chat application built using Python and the Flask web framework for the backend. 
It leverages Flask-SocketIO to enable real-time communication through WebSocket. 
Users can access a web-based chat interface where they can join a chat room and send messages to each other. 
Messages are displayed in real-time to all participants in the chat room. 
The program uses Flask to serve web pages and handle incoming WebSocket events, creating a basic but functional chat application for real-time communication.
